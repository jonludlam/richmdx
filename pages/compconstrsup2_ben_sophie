{1 Question 1}

{2 Ben}

Unnecessary to put the function in a ref. Having [not_done] as a ref also a little unnecessary in this case, but no bad thing. Otherwise looks fine

{2 Sophie}

Similar with the [not_done]


{1 Question 2}

{2 Ben}

Good, following the lectures in the derivation

{2 Sophie}

fine

{1 Question 3}

{2 Ben}

Good. The [Update_if_list] is a bit of a mouthful, and actually unnecessary. We can just have our [env] as a list of pairs.

{2 Sophie}

Not done?

{1 Question 4}

{2 Ben}

Good.

{2 Sophie}

OK, but don't put syntactically incorrect stuff in answers, unless clearly annotated as such!
